  At many discussion platforms I have found that machine learning enthusiast are always interested to know how AI is helping in precise treatment of cancer patients. I always tell them many approaches which are dependent on the what data we have and in what question we are interested in?  But in this blog I am going to discuss a very interesting application of topic modeling approach which is getting widely popular in cancer patient specific clinical decision making.
  
  In the era of the internet, billions of documents are available online and presenting these documents to the users as a collection of words makes no sense. So, it is always desirable to organise these documents by the topic composition that can be understood by the user and topic modelling techniques are widely used to automate this task. Technically, the idea of topic modelling is to reduce the dimension of the documents from total unique word counts in the document database to a limited number of topics.
  
  Let's understand it with the help of a super easy hypothetical example in Figure 1. Suppose we have a corpus of `D` number of documents which has `W`  number of unique words. Here each document can be represented as a word spectrum of unique words (rows in Matrix `X`).  But we know words in any document originated from the topics being covered in the given document and the whole corpus will have very few independent topics, let's say `T` (`T<<W`). The objective of the topic modelling approach is to find the intensity/proportion of independent topics in each document where each topic has a specific spectrum of `W` unique words.  This way we can represent any document of our corpus by a lower dimensional topic spectrum instead of a higher dimensional word spectrum.  This can be done by non-negative factorisation (NMF) of  Matrix `X` into the topic intensity matrix `I` and topics word distribution matrix `S`. Where each row in a  topic intensity matrix `I` represents the intensity (proportion) of the independent topics in the row document. NMF algorithm works in the following two steps
  
 NMF Steps

 * Step 1 (Calculate Matrix `S`): The co-occurrence matrix of the `X` (document and word matrix)  is decomposed by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method into the eigenvector matrix `S`  and eigenvalues matrix `R`.  We know eigenvectors are independent/orthogonal of each other and eigenvalues show the importance of eigenvectors. Here, only eigenvectors with high eigenvalues are selected such that they can reproduce the co-occurrence matrix of the `X`  with minimum error. The eigenvectors with low eigenvalues are due to noise hence they are not selected here. The obtained eigenvector matrix `S` has independent word spectrums along rows whose linear combination can reproduce the word spectrum of any document in the corpus and each word spectrum belongs to an independent topic.  
 * Step 2 (Estimate Matrix `I`): We know the matrix `X` and we have obtained matrix `S` from step 1. Now we can easily estimate the Matrix `I` using an optimization strategy to minimise the error (err).

  In a cancer cell, many mutational processes continue to act on it and each of the mutational processes has distinct mutational spectra also known as mutational signatures. The strength/intensity of mutational signatures in cancer patients is used to group them into multiple subgroups, where each subgroup has a similar mutational process profile and a similar treatment strategy. Figure  2 maps the topic modelling terms to the mutational signature modelling terms and will help in understanding the concept of mutational signatures.

Topics summarize corpus of documents, similarly mutational signatures summarize the mutational catalogues of cancer patients.
