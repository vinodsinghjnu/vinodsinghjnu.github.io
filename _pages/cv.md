Education
======
* 2010-2017 Ph.D (Computational Biology and Bioinformatics), Jawaharlal Nehru University.
* 2008-2010 M. Tech. (Computational and Systems Biology), Jawaharlal Nehru University.
* 2003-2007 B. Tech. (Biotechnology), Kurukshetra University. 
 

Work experience
======

* 2020/03- Present: Researcher, University of Gothenburg
  * Responsibilities: Planning and completion of research projects, followed by publishing or reporting new findings to the scientific community.

  * I am trying to develop an Artificial-Intelligence (AI) based treatment guiding system for skin cancer patients by utilizing their the genomic and clinical data. Details of my projects are given below

  *	Project 1: Diverse range mutation and epi-genomics data of the cancer cells involved in cancer progression. So, the focus of my work is on data normalization techniques to Integrate multimodal data and to develop of artificial intelligence (AI) based clinical decision-making system that can be used for precise treatment of melanoma patients. 

  * Project 2: This is a collaborative project where I used barseq (barcode high throughput sequencing) data of yeast deletion strains to discover the genes responsible for delay in cell division in mitochondria-depleted cells.

   * Skills: Data Science · NGS data analysis · Genomics · R · High Performance Computing (HPC)
	

* 2019/11-2020/03: Post-Doctoral researcher, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, USA
  
  * Responsibilities: Planning and completion of research projects, followed by publishing or reporting new findings to scientific community.

  * Project 1: New DNA sequencing technologies, such as single-cell RNA-seq, produces very high-dimensional (~30,000 x 1,000,000) datasets, visualizing this data is challenging but useful to understand many biological processes. So, I have developed an interactive tool named “Stereo3D” that reduces the dimension of data to 3D and produces interactive stereo images for better visualization. Detailed information about this work can be found in the research publication section below.

 * Project 2:  I developed an software tool named "HSMotifDiscover" and Its app, to discover patterns in specific type of biological sequences. This tool uses specialized version of the Gibbs-sampling optimization algorithm to detect the conserved patterns in the sequences. A detailed description of the work can be found in the publication section below. A detailed description of the work can be found in the publication section below.

 * Skills: Statistical Learning · Software dovelopemnt · Gibbs-Sampling optimisation · Rotational Matrices · R
  
* 2018/03-2019/11: Post-Doctoral researcher, Rutgers cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Jersey, USA
  * Github University
  * Duties included: Tagging issues
  * Supervisor: Professor Git
