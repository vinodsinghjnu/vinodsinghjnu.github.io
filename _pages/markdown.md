I'm part of a dynamic research group of 7-8 researchers with diverse backgrounds, all united by a common goal: developing AI-based solutions to personalize cancer treatment.  Within this team, I leverage my data science expertise and computational knowledge to unlock the insights hidden within complex datasets. I also play a key role in troubleshooting any challenges that arise throughout the research process.  Here's a typical framework for my research activities over the years.

The dramatic drop in genome sequencing costs has opened up a wealth of data, making terabytes of genomic and clinical data of hundreds of thousands of cancer patients readily available to study cancer development. My role is to harness this vast resource by integrating and analyzing this multimodal data to create patient profiles and develop AI-powered solutions for personalized cancer treatment. The effectiveness of these AI models hinges on the quality of the features used for profiling.  Therefore, I dedicate a significant portion of my time to identifying relevant features through dimensionality reduction techniques and ensuring their effective integration.  This process is highly collaborative, with oncologists, computational scientists, and biologists regularly reviewing the selected features and their impact on the model's performance.  Given the potential impact on human lives, this iterative review and improvement process is paramount.

While deep learning models are a powerful tool for data integration in many applications, their limitations come into play when dealing with limited datasets or the need for interpretable results, especially when dealing with human subjects.  Therefore, we carefully evaluate the feasibility of deep learning for each application, employing alternative approaches when necessary.
