I work in a research group of 7-8 researchers from diverse backgrounds but our objective is to develop AI-based solutions to recommend the best treatment for cancer patients. My role in the group is to provide my data science skills and computational knowledge to understand the data and troubleshoot the problems encountered in the process. Here is a typical framework of my research over the years.

For a couple of years, genome sequencing cost has significantly reduced which has made the availability of hundereds of thousands cancer patients' genomic data at affordable price. My job is to integrate and utilise this enormous amount of multimodal data for profiling cancer patients and build Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for their optimal treatment. The performance of AI-based models largly depends on the features used for profiling cancer patients, hence my significant amount of time is consumed in discovering the relevant features using dimensionality reduction techniques and their integration. The filtered features and their impact on the model's performance are regularly discussed and reviewed by a team of experts which includes oncologists, computational scientists, and biologists. Since our work impacts human subjects, the review and improvement process goes on iteratively.

For many applications related to data integrations, we also use deep learning models. However, in many other applications, where the training dataset is limited or we need proper reasoning for the output, deep learning models are discouraged because a human subject is involved here. But still, we do a feasibility study of these models in our applications.
